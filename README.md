# 01-Challenge

Hello!! This is my first ever project and official repo on github, this project was a class asignment to show my knowledge on code refactoring. This is a 100% html site that had a lot of issues with css organiztion and had some issues inside the html aswell. 

# How I Refactored the code:
I tried to use scouts honour by making the css selectors' more efficient and simple by consolidating the most of the css selectors into clean groups. I also changed the css order to more follow the semantic elements that are shown in the html so the css wasn't too confusing to look at. I used to comments to explain what I grouped/consolidated and also used comments that explained what section the css corespondes with the html. The comments are differentiated by capitalizing html corresponded sections and leaving comments about css all lower case. 
On the html side I fixed a broken link on the header and fixed an img tag's format towards the end of the footer that way they all end in /> to keep with html 5 standards, along with some general seo fixes. All of these fixes however, actually do not change how the code works, just makes the code prettire. 

# What I learned and closing thoughts :)
I feel like I learned a lot about how to keep a website looking clean and organized not only for myself but if I ever decide I need help it would be an extremely good idea to keep both my html and css as clean as possible like how I tried to show here that way some one (or me) doesn't just see a problem they have to decipher first.  

Thanks for reading :D
